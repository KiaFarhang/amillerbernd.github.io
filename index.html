                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a small Minnesota suburb called South St. Paul. After graduation, I went on to the University of North Dakota. For North Dakota-related reasons, and because Minneapolis has a better media market, I left for the University
                    of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>I took an internship back in Fargo and then moved out to California just because I wanted a change in scenery. I now work as the morning cops reporter for the Press-Enterprise (My stuff sits mostly <a href="http://www.pe.com/" alt="Riverside Press-Enterprise"
                        title="Riverside Press-Enterprise" target="_blank">in the box on the right-hand side at

                <p><em><strong>Some quick facts:</strong></em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am a vegetarian, for no other reason than I simply don’t like the consistency of meat.</li>
                    <li>My only brother, Mike, graduated with a mathematics degree, and my parents are both in accounting. Christmas is weird.</li>
                    <li>I like to spend my spare time using public (or requested, but still public) data to make fancy visualizations. Those are a work-in-progress, but I’ve gotten pretty good if you ask me.</li>
                    <li>I worked at hair salons and spas during college as a receptionist – partially because of electric bills, and partially because I liked getting to know the different clients who would come in.</li>
